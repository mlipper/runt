* Added events method to Schedule which returns an Array of the currrently held Events

* Added time-related shortcuts to Runt module contributed by Ara T. Howard

* Added ability to work with Time class contributed by Paul Wright

* Implemented meaningful to_s methods for TExpr classes

* Applied patch by Gordon Thiesfeld which fixes broken Time class compatibility

* Removed unused context.rb and contexttest.rb

* Removed unnecessary test suite alltests.rb

== Version 0.4.0

* Added REMonth expression which matches a range of dates each month

  - usage of gzip which will break on Win32

* Removed and then subsequently restored SpecTE

* General clean-up, including:
  - renamed several methods on PDate
  - renamed 'dateprecisiontest.rb' to 'dprecisiontest.rb'

* Fixed Object.id deprecation warning


== Version 0.2.0

* Fixed Schedule class
* Renamed Schedule#is_occurring? to Schedule#include?
* RAA deployment
* GEM deployment
* Renamed file dateprecisiontest.rb to dprecisiontest.rb
* Renamed several methods on PDate:
  - second -> sec
  - minute -> min
  - hour_of_day -> hour
  - day_of_month -> day

== Version 0.1.0

* Inspired by suggestions[http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/95465] on c.l.r., did massive renaming and refactoring to make source more Ruby-esque:

  - TemporalExpression class => TExpr
  - DatePrecision module => DPrecision (file name changed also)
  - TimePoint class => PDate (file name changed also)
  - Added transparent use of bitwise set operators ( & , | ) for building composite expressions
  - Added transparent use of - operator for diff expressions

* Updated TE Tutorial to reflect new and improved syntax usage
* Skipped several version numbers to celebrate

== Version 0.0.6
